This directory contains two scripts for generating SNAP potentials:

1) feature_analysis.py: This script is used to generate the SNAP coefficients.
2) potential_fitting.py: This script is used for fitting the potential to calculate material properties.

Additionally, the directory includes the following important files:

Cu.snapcoeff: Contains the coefficients after training, used as SNAP potentials.
Cu.snapparam: Contains the hyperparameters required for generating the coefficients.

The data required for training is available in the 'data' directory. You can either use this data by providing the location or upload your data to the drive and use it.
